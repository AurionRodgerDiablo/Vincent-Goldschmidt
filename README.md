## Repository overview

This repository contains a simple workflow diagram created with draw.io. The file [`Diagramme sans nom.drawio`](./Diagramme%20sans%20nom.drawio) outlines how I manage research documents by checking whether each file has been processed and determining the next action. I use this diagram as part of my exploration of AI and large language models for automating medical imaging and biomarker analysis workflows. As my PhD work evolves, the diagram will serve as a starting point for more detailed models and projects.
